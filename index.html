<h3><i><mark>A GOOD LISTENER</mark></i></h3>
<div><img src="FriendsOne.jpg" alt="besfrend" style="float:left;width:180px;height:180px;"><mark>I would like to share with you that I am a good listener. If my friend are having their problem I would really love to hear their problems and I would love to help them settle their problems. But not most of the time I could help them settle their problems, sometimes I just can lend my ears in order to make sure that they would feel a little less burdened by the problems. I love to help my friend. It would make me feel grateful with my life because sometimes I would always feel that my problems are so big and I can handle it while there’s a lot of people out there that are still struggling with the problems that is more serious than mine.</mark></div>
<h3><i><mark>I LOVE BAKING</mark></i></h3> 
<div><img src="Cookies.jpg" alt="kukis" style="float:right;width:180px;height:180px;"><mark>Apart from being a good listener, I would to share with you that I also love to bake during my leisure time. As for me, baking is like a therapy after im doing a long task work such as homework and assignment. In order to release my stress I would bake something sweets that I can enjoy it and share it with my family members.  Usually I would bake something simple such as chocolate chip cookies, butter cake and non baked oreo cheesecake. Eating sweets food will always boost my mood again. I am grateful that I got all this talent from my mother. Whenever im feel sad and tired I would bake and it will make me happy.</mark></div>
